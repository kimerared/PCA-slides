# What is PCA?

-   Dimensionality reduction technique.
-   Purpose:
    -   Simplification of complex datasets.
    -   Preservation of essential information.

# Why Use PCA?

-   Reducing Dimensionality: Simplify high-dimensional data.
-   Visualizing Data: Help visualize data in lower dimensions.
-   Noise Reduction: Eliminate less relevant features.
-   Improved Model Performance: Enhance machine learning efficiency.

# Methods

-   Data Matrix: Start with a matrix X of size n x m.
-   Centering: Subtract the mean of each feature.
-   Covariance Matrix: Calculate the covariance matrix of the centered data.
-   Select Principal Components: Choose top eigenvectors.

# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

-   Eigenvectors: Represent directions of maximum variance.
-   Eigenvalues: Indicate the variance explained by each eigenvector.
-   Sorting: Sort eigenvalues in descending order to select the most significant components.

# Variance Explained

-   Explained Variance Ratio: Calculate the ratio of each eigenvalue.
-   Cumulative Variance: Plot cumulative explained variance to determine components to retain.

# Dimensionality Reduction

-   Unsupervised Learning.
-   Reduce Dimensions: Transform data by multiplying with selected eigenvectors.
-   New Feature Space: Data exists in a lower-dimensional feature space.

# Visualization

-   Data Projection: Visualize data in the reduced feature space.
-   Scatterplots: Use scatterplots to visualize data distribution.

# Assumptions and Limitations

-   Interpretability: Loss of interpretability in transformed features.
-   Loss of Information: Reducing dimensionality may result in some information loss.
-   Scaling: Data scaling is important to avoid feature dominance.

# Applications of PCA

-   Image Compression: Reduce image size while preserving details.
-   Face Recognition: Reduce facial feature dimensions for classification.
-   Anomaly Detection: Identify anomalies in large datasets.
-   Bioinformatics: Analyze gene expression data.

# Dataset Overview

-   39 variables, or features.

-   55 Observations.

-   Administered to In-Center Hemodialysis Survey.

-   State-level averages.

-   Dialysis Quality measures.

# Variables / Features

**Index Variable:**

-   "State," 50 states & 6 U.S. territories.

**Response Variables:**

-   24 variables align with patient care quality ratings in dialysis facilities.

-   Transfusions, fistula usage, infections, hospitalizations, incident waitlisting, & readmissions.

# Variables / Features

**Classification of Dialysis Patients:**

-   14 variables based on dialysis adequacy (Kt/V), type of dialysis, normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), hypercalcemia level, serum phosphorus level, and average hemoglobin level.

# Dataset Selection Rationale

-   Driven by multicollinearity.

-   Certain variables less significant in explaining variability of response variables.

-   All variables are numeric, except the index variable.

# Data Preparation  {.smaller}

-   Efficient removal of white spaces in the dataset.

-   Editing variable names to enhance readability and meaninful.

-   **Example:**

    -   Original: "Percentage.Of.Adult..Patients.With.Hypercalcemia..Serum.Calcium.Greater.Than.10.2.Mg.dL."

    -   Transformed: "hypercalcemia_calcium \> 10.2Mg."

# PCA in Machine Learning

-   Feature Selection: Use PCA to select relevant features.
-   Model Training: Enhance model performance by reducing dimensionality.
-   Preprocessing: Standardize and normalize data before applying PCA.

# Conclusion

-   Summary: PCA is an unsupervised learning technique for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.
-   Key Takeaways: Understand eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and explained variance.
